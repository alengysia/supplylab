# supplylab
Supplylab brings donors and educators together to bridge the supply gap and ensure every student and class has high quality art and school supplies. 

As a full-stack Django app, supplylab provides a user-friendly interface where donors can search for schools to support, while educators can register and manage their on-going supply needs. 

Django's extensive authentication and authorization functionality is implemented to provide security across the app, ensuring data integrity and protection for users while persisting data in the PostgresSQL database.

# IceBox - Future Features
Supplylab is an ever-evolving platform ready to scale alongside our users' needs. Future features will bring additional functionality forward for both educators and donors including:
- User Profiles and Roles - Expanded user functionality will allow donors, individual educators, and administrators to create and manage profiles. Roles will allow each user type to access tailored site functionality, such as donor records and school user groups.

- Photo Upload - Along with user profiles and roles, supplylab will offer future functionality to allow users to upload a profile picture to further personalize the user experience and help build community across user types.

- API Integration - Supplylab is seeking to integrate with an external API in future releases to increase the data available to users for inclusion in classroom profiles without requiring users to manually enter all data.

- In-App Communication - In-app messaging funcationality will reduce barriers by allowing donors and educators to connect directly to discuss logistics, clarify specific needs, or simply build community among regular users.
